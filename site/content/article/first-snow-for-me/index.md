Sadly, I missed the first snow which fell on the Pilat mounts, next to my home.

As it melted pretty fast, I had to wait for the second snow fall, which fortunately happend on a friday, giving me the opportunity to come see it on saturday.

The forest was beautiful, partly covered in snow and hidden in the cloud.
All these elements added interesting layers to the scene :

There were also many natural textures in the "chirats", those rock formations typical to the region :

By the way, below is my first correct photo of a kestrel falcon, found next to the road. As it quickly moved away, I wasn't able to find a better angle with a proper background instead of this uniform boring sky.
