Hello there!

I am Camille, and this is my first article on my new personal site, built by my geeky fingers. If you want to learn more about me, please check my [About]({{< relref "about.md" >}}) page!

This site will present some of my photos, for now divided between two galleries : [Urban]({{< relref "gallery/urban/index.md" >}}) and [Nature]({{< relref "gallery/nature/index.md" >}}).

I will also use this blog to share my experiences and write about what I do, always about photography or related to it.

And now let the fun begin!
