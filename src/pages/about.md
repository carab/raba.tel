Hello there!

My name is Camille Rabatel, and I am a web engineer from Lyon, France.

I have been interested by photography since my younger years, but I really started investing time into it during my 3 years in Brussels, when I was offered a used Nikon D90.

This Nikon really helped me understand photography, but I've now been seduced by the Fuji system and have acquired an X-T1.

You will find on this website my favorite images from various types of photography, along some articles of my different experiences.

If you have any questions or requests, please do not hesitate to contact me using the form below. I'll reach back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you, and [thanks to them](/thanks).  
Camille.
