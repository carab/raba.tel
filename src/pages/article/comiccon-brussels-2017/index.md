===> ENLEVER les "you", c'est pas un cours mais un rappel d'exp√©rience.

Two major geek events just happened within two weeks in Brussels : the Comic Con from the 24th to the 26th february, and the Made In Asia from the 3rd to the 5th march.

I have already attended to the MIA 2 times before, which seems to be the one big event in Belgium. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the activities, the people and most of all, the sublime cosplayers you can find at each corners of the show.

This year, I managed to get tickets for the Comic Con, which was until now quite a small event compared to the MIA. Hopefully, the staff chose a new space in Tour & Taxi and the show can now welcome many more visitors than before.

I would like to come back on my experience and
My goal during the week-end was to photograph as much as cosplayers as possible, and to try to convey the vibe going on through my shots. It was the first time I really tried to make good pictures in this kind of event, and I must say I learned a lot during this two days.

First and foremost, I already knew it, but it must be said again : cosplayers are very nice, very open, and really friendly. For this, they make perfect models to learn, because most of them already know how to pose, and you just have to shoot. So do not hesitate to ask them a picture if they are not already posing for someone else.

I am kind of a shy guy, mostly because I don't like to disturb people (or so I tell myself), so I know it is hard at the beginning, but the more you ask, the more you become confident. The only moment not to ask is actually when the cosplayer is taking a break, resting or eating. And of course, do not push it if someone says no, they have the right to refuse and we must accept it (though it never happened to me).


One thing I have found very important when shooting a cosplayer, is to have eye contact. It may not be mandatory because you can make something more creative if the cosplayer is looking in another direction, specially for close-up portrait I guess, but for a general view of the costume, it looks better to me.

As I said, most cosplayers know how to pose their character, so let them have it their way. Thus, you'll be able to focus on the rest, like the exposure and the composition.

As in any other field of the photography, light is very important and must be taken in account when photographing. In this type of indoor event, light may be missing so you will have to push a little on the ISO. I own a Fuji X-T1 so keep in mind the ISO values doesn't mean the same as with Canon or Nikon (for some reason).
